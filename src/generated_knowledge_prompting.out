(Verse 1)
Yo, I'm on a mission, seeking justice with precision
In a world full of corruption, fighting for the vision
I walk alone, like a lone wolf in the night
Challenging the system, shining my light bright

People crowded in the shadows, living in despair
I'm the voice of the voiceless, their stories I share
From the streets to the courts, I speak truth to power
Bringing hope to the hopeless, every minute, every hour

(Chorus)
I'm the lone wolf howling at the moon
Justice is my armor, the fight will end soon
In a world full of chaos, I stand tall
Rapping for the underdogs, answering the call

(Verse 2)
They try to silence me, but my words are like a thunder
Rising from the ashes, I refuse to go under
From the ghettos to the suburbs, I bring the message clear
No matter where you're from, we all shed the same tear

I see the pain in their eyes, the struggle in their soul
I'm the voice of the silenced, making their stories whole
One mic, one mission, I'm here to bring change
With every rhyme I spit, the status quo rearrange

(Chorus)
I'm the lone wolf howling at the moon
Justice is my armor, the fight will end soon
In a world full of chaos, I stand tall
Rapping for the underdogs, answering the call

(Bridge)
In a world full of darkness, I'm a beacon of light
Guiding the lost souls, ready to take flight
I may walk alone, but together we're strong
Injustice will fall, and we'll right the wrongs

(Chorus)
I'm the lone wolf howling at the moon
Justice is my armor, the fight will end soon
In a world full of chaos, I stand tall
Rapping for the underdogs, answering the call

(Outro)
So listen up, world, 'cause the lone wolf's on the rise
With justice as my weapon, I'll never compromise
From the block to the boardroom, I'll fight till the end
This is more than just a song, it's a message I send
